        <h2>About me</h2>
        <P>I bring a comprehensive set of skills that I believe will be valuable. I'm a fast learner and highly self-motivated. 
            During COVID-19 lockdown I have decided to capitalize on my free time and decided to learn a new skill. After 
            learning Python programming on my own through various books I have enrolled in a Software Engineer Bootcamp 
            at HyperionDev. During the course I have improved Python, learned about SQL and Django and created over 30 programs 
            in these languages.</P>
        <p>In my previous roles I’ve managed IT Outsourcing projects partnering with Unisys and continually strengthened key 
            accounts relations through personalized contact and open ongoing communication. Worked in retail sector and achieved 
            great results adapting analitycal thinking and problem-solving attitude.</p>
        <p>I have a great passion for outdoors! Abosulutely love snowboarding and trekking, something about mountains makes me more complete and
            at peace. I've hiked Camino de Santiago in Spain which was first incredible experience, had a bit thougher and challenging journey
            through West Hihgland Way in Scotland and just recently visited Nepal and had a chance to see metaphorically and literally the most 
            breahtaking mountains in my life.</p>
